# Coming up

- 30th January: **The metacience of peer review**, as part of "[Does AI threaten research integrity?](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/whats-on/room-2-62/eleanor-rathbone-building/does-ai-threaten-research-integrity/e-jopdkk)" at University of Liverpool

  - Abstract:  Peer review is central to the lives of researchers - it determines if our papers get accented and if our funding proposals are successful. Metascience - also known as the science of science, or research on research - takes peer review as an object of study in its own right, and asks what we have learnt about how peer review works and how it might be improved. I'll discuss how we worked with a research funder to evaluate a trial of Distributed Peer Review  (a system where applicants for a funding call review each others' applications), and talk about the topics in the psychology of expertise, judgement and decision making can be given new relevance in the study of peer review.

# Past talks

## 2026

- 22nd January: **Funder experimentation with AI**, [Ensuring Value in Research EViR](https://evir.org/)

  - Topic: There are many opportunities in research funding to use AI, such as improving applicant experience, reviewer selection, evaluation processes and feedback. In this talk I will introduce the Research on Research Institute's work on AI, covering our project on responsible use of AI by research funders (GRAIL) and our workshops on how to develop evaluation experiments on the use of AI in research funding (AFIRE). I will share experiences of research funders with evaluating AI use, and suggest principles for making progress in this area. <https://researchonresearch.org/project/a-f-i-r-e/>

- 8th September: "Research Culture in the UK". Keynote at [Pujiang Innovation Forum 2024](https://en.pujiangforum.cn/en/en_news_show.aspx?channel_id=20&cateid=175&id=119), Shanghai, China.

  - Britain has a rich industrial and scientific heritage, with an established and diverse research culture anchored within a world-leading University sector. Successfully sustaining and building on the reputation of British research means addressing the challenges and criticisms of how research culture has developed in the 21st century. I will review some of these challenges - hypercompetition and excessive workload, employment precarity, perverse metrics, unfortunate publishing practices, lack of transparency, irreproducibility of findings and threats to international collaboration - and suggest ways forward.
  - Slides: [PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YbnKHHsHI--njavxH7Kp_bdAzCU3UHQTkSEUzjZgfKc/edit?usp=sharing), [PDF](docs/shanghai2024-09-09.pdf)

- 9th September: "Experiments with the funding of research". [Shanghai Institute for Science of Science](https://www.siss.sh.cn/eng/).

  - Research funders share some common concerns: how do they know if they are allocating funding in the way that is most effective, fair and best balances risks versus possible rewards? Although a large variety of different funding systems exist, rigorous evidence on how funding can be designed to promote the best outcomes is not common. I will speak about the Research on Research Institute, and the programme on formal experiments that I lead there: AFIRE <https://researchonresearch.org/project/a-f-i-r-e> I will showcase good examples of strong evidence on aspects of funding systems, and talk about how funders might better use and generate evidence in the future

    -   Researchers spend hours and hours writing funding proposals and in the end bad ideas get funded and good ideas get missed. Everyone has the suspicion that the funding process is biased against people in the wrong fields, from the wrong institutions or with the wrong backgrounds. Can research funding be improved, and what does the evidence say? Tom will talk about work from the Research on Research Institute, and about projects on innovations in how research funding is awarded.[  https://researchonresearch.org/](https://researchonresearch.org/)

    -   Complex data and complex methods mean multiple statistical analyses are potentially legitimate. Multiverse analysis offers a tool to interrogate the stability of results under different analysis choices. After introducing the general history and rationale of multiverse analysis, I will talk about two multiverse projects I have been involved in, both in my research area of bias and decision making, and what we have learned from them

    -   Human reasoning in the digital age has a terrible reputation. People are often portrayed as hopelessly biased, polarised and resistant to good sense, while - strangely - also being easily manipulated by malevolent forces and bizarre fads. From the trenches of psychological science, I bring you good news! I will discuss two strands of work. In the first, we show that even minimal deliberation allows online groups to select away from intuitive but wrong answers (and that there are prospects for language-model based dialogue agents to support good group reasoning). More at [delibot.xyz](https://www.delibot.xyz/). In the second strand of research we show that, across polarising topics, UK partisans are surprisingly good at representing the views of the ideological opponents, and that the better people are at this the more likely they are to view people they disagree with as moral, informed and rational.

In this talk, with the use of many examples, I will show how the study of illusions provides important lessons for psychologists trying to understand all aspects of mind, brain and behaviour

-   16 June 2021 - Why you should use decision models with your response time and accuracy data at [Centre for Cognition and Neuroscience](https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/ccn/), University of Huddersfield (and online).

    Decision modelling is increasingly accessible and yields highly practical benefits to experimental psychologists. This talk will explain why and how you should apply decision models to your data.

    Response time and accuracy are fundamental measures of behavioural science, but discerning participants' underlying abilities can be masked by speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATOs). SATOs are often inadequately addressed in experiment analyses which focus on a single variable or which involve a suboptimal analytic correction. Models of decision making, such as the drift diffusion model (DDM), provide a principled account of the decision making process, allowing the recovery of SATO-unconfounded decision parameters from observed behavioural variables.

    I will show, using simulations and worked examples from experimental data, how decision models allow potentially massive increases in statistical power at the same time as helping you avoid mistaken inferences due to variations in participants' SATOs strategies. Because the modelling community has focussed on differences between different decision models, this has disguised the fact that there is now a consensus around the core mechanisms which define the family of plausible decision models, as well as increasing agreement on tools for fitting behavioural data with these decision models.
