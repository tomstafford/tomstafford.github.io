[The DIY book for cognitive science](http://mindhacks.com/book). 100 things you can try at home which will teach you how the mind works.

"The authors have compiled a fascinating "collection of probes into the moment-by-moment works of the brain" ... Mind Hacks allows you to test the theories of neuroscience on your own grey matter. If you've always wanted to get closer to your cerebellum but never plucked up the courage to take that DIY neurosurgery course, this is the book for you." --- The Guardian

"A wonderful annotated bibliography, with a light touch and hackish humour that inspires further reading." --- New Scientist


# For argument's sake: evidence that reason can change minds

![](images/fas_small.jpg){width="25%"}

Are we irrational creatures, swayed by emotion and entrenched biases? Modern psychology and neuroscience are often reported as showing that we can't overcome our prejudices and selfish motivations. In this long essay (short ebook) I challenge this view. Re-analysing classic experiments on persuasion, as well as summarising more recent research into how arguments change minds, I show that the evidence is that persuasion by reason alone can be a powerful force.

I also wrote the essays which intersperse the [Rough Guide Book of Brain Training](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rough-Guide-Brain-Training-Guides/dp/1848365187) (2010).
