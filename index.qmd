I study learning and decision making. Much of my research looks at risk and bias, and their management, in decision making. I am also interested in skill learning, using measures of behaviour informed by work done in computational theory and neuroscience. More recently a strand of my research looks at complex decisions, and the psychology of reason, argument and persuasion.
