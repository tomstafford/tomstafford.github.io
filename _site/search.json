    "text": "As Professor of Cognitive Science, I teach and research in the School of Psychology at the University of Sheffield. My work applies insights from neuroscience, experimental design and data science to the topics of learning, decision making, reasoning and bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews!\n\n\n\nFrom 1st September 2025 - 31st August 2026 I am on leave from the University of Sheffield. During this time I will be on secondment to the Research on Research Institute, as well as pursing writing projects. Subscribe for updates on tomstafford.substack.com/.\n\n\nAs Senior Fellow at the Research on Research Institute, I lead the programme AFIRE: Accelerator For Innovation & Research Funding Experimentation. We seek to catalyse the generation and use of high quality evidence on research processes (“Metaresearch”).\nI am on the PsyArXiv Scientific Advisory Board as chair of the Public Engagement Subcommittee.\nPreviously, I was Director for the MSc programmes in Psychological Research Methods, and set up the MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. You can read more about the flagshiop module I designed and taught here: PSY6422 Data Analysis and Visualisation.\nFrom 2020 to 2025 I held the Research Practice Lead for the University of Sheffield, an institution-wide role with a remit to encourage practices which support robust and trusted research. As Research Practice Lead, I represented the University of Sheffield in the UK Reproducibility Network, for which I chaired the national UKRN Institutional Leads group 2023 - 2025.\nFor non-specialist audiences, I have written a best-selling book, an award winning blog and columns for venues including BBC, New Scientist, The Guardian and The Conversation. I have also written some mediocre selling books, some widely ignored blogs and tweeted jokes which I thought were hilarious at the time but which received precisely zero likes and zero retweets.\nThese pages are intended to replace tomstafford.sites.sheffield.ac.uk, and will reflect my professional activities.\nMy non-professional activities are recorded on my personal blog at https://idiolect.org.uk/notes/\nOr you can find traces on these other platforms:"

Successfully sustaining and building on the reputation of British research means addressing the challenges and criticisms of how research culture has developed in the 21st century. I will review some of these challenges - hypercompetition and excessive workload, employment precarity, perverse metrics, unfortunate publishing practices, lack of transparency, irreproducibility of findings and threats to international collaboration - and suggest ways forward.\nSlides: PPT, PDF\n\n9th September: “Experiments with the funding of research”.

Although a large variety of different funding systems exist, rigorous evidence on how funding can be designed to promote the best outcomes is not common. I will speak about the Research on Research Institute, and the programme on formal experiments that I lead there: AFIRE https://researchonresearch.org/project/a-f-i-r-e I will showcase good examples of strong evidence on aspects of funding systems, and talk about how funders might better use and generate evidence in the future\nSlides: PPT, PDF, transcript\n\n22nd May 2024 AFIRE Project, Research on Research Institute at Seminar: Interventions for Funding Application Assessments for EDI Caucus\n17th April 2024, Improving The Research Funding Lottery at School of Architecture, University of Sheffield.\n\nResearchers spend hours and hours writing funding proposals and in the end bad ideas get funded and good ideas get missed. Everyone has the suspicion that the funding process is biased against people in the wrong fields, from the wrong institutions or with the wrong backgrounds.

After introducing the general history and rationale of multiverse analysis, I will talk about two multiverse projects I have been involved in, both in my research area of bias and decision making, and what we have learned from them\nSlides: “Adventures in the Multiverse” (PDF)\n\n19th January 2024 6pm UK time, Google IQ Research Talk: When people are wrong on the internet - reasons to be optimistic (host Mevan Babakar)\n\nHuman reasoning in the digital age has a terrible reputation. People are often portrayed as hopelessly biased, polarised and resistant to good sense, while - strangely - also being easily manipulated by malevolent forces and bizarre fads. From the trenches of psychological science, I bring you good news! I will discuss two strands of work. In the first, we show that even minimal deliberation allows online groups to select away from intuitive but wrong answers (and that there are prospects for language-model based dialogue agents to support good group reasoning). More at delibot.xyz. In the second strand of research we show that, across polarising topics, UK partisans are surprisingly good at representing the views of the ideological opponents, and that the better people are at this the more likely they are to view people they disagree with as moral, informed and rational. More in Brand, Brady & Stafford (2023). \nSlides, PDF"

This talk will explain why and how you should apply decision models to your data.\nResponse time and accuracy are fundamental measures of behavioural science, but discerning participants’ underlying abilities can be masked by speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATOs). SATOs are often inadequately addressed in experiment analyses which focus on a single variable or which involve a suboptimal analytic correction. Models of decision making, such as the drift diffusion model (DDM), provide a principled account of the decision making process, allowing the recovery of SATO-unconfounded decision parameters from observed behavioural variables.\nI will show, using simulations and worked examples from experimental data, how decision models allow potentially massive increases in statistical power at the same time as helping you avoid mistaken inferences due to variations in participants’ SATOs strategies. Because the modelling community has focussed on differences between different decision models, this has disguised the fact that there is now a consensus around the core mechanisms which define the family of plausible decision models, as well as increasing agreement on tools for fitting behavioural data with these decision models.\nStafford, T., Pirrone, A., Croucher, M., and Krystalli, A.

    "text": "University of Sheffield\nTo 2025 I was Director for the MSc programmes in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. I was founding director for MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. I designed and led an MSc module in data management and visualisation.\nIn 2020 the Department of Psychology completed a redesign and overhaul of its undergraduate, based around a programme level approach. I contributed to this as lead for one of the five core streams – cognitive psychology.\nI was stream lead for cognitive psychology on the undergraduate psychology BSc. Within that, I teach level 1 and 2 students the psychology of decision making, skill and reasoning.\nPreviously I have taught Synthetic Psychology, using Lego robots and Jupyter notebooks to show how building models of behaviour can help us understand the nature of mind.\nI taught a graduate seminar on contentious issues in cognitive neuroscience for several years, including dual process accounts, sex differences in the brain, and the reliability crisis in cognitive neuroscience. This module was based on the principles of inquiry-based learning and uses unresolved questions in the cognitive neurosciences to teach critical analysis of research literature and how to build a novel and interesting scientific arguments. I have published a paper and a short report on the design of the course:\n\nStafford, T. (2008), A fire to be lighted: a case-study in enquiry-based learning, Practice and Evidence of Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, Vol. 3, No. 1, April 2008, pp.20-42.\nStafford, T.

HEA Psychology Network Newsletter, Issue 46, January 2008.\n\nWhen I was module organiser for PSY241/3 Cognitive Psychology. I designed the course around the use of a wiki – an user editable webpage which allows writing practice, collaboration and encourages a critical approach to sources. Students who used the wiki more during the course scores higher on the exam:\n\nStafford, T., Elgueta, H., and Cameron, H. (2014). Students’ engagement with a collaborative wiki tool predicts enhanced written exam performance.

    "text": "New paper: A novel task for the investigation of action acquisition\nOriginally published 2012-06-04.\n\nOur new paper, A novel task for the investigation of action acquisition, has been published in PLoS One today. The paper describes a new paradigm we’ve been using to investigate how actions are learnt.\nIt’s a curious fact that although psychologists have thoroughly investigated how actions are valued (ie how you figure out how good or bad a thing is to do), and how actions are trained (ie shaped and refined over time), the same effort has not gone into investigating how a behaviour is first identified and stored as a part of our repertoire. We hope this task provides a useful tool for opening up this area for investigation.\nAs well as the basic description of the task, the paper also contains a section outlining how the form of learning the the task makes available for inspection is different from the forms of learning made available by other ‘action learning’ tasks (for example, operant conditioning tasks).\nIn addition to serving an under-investigated area of learning research, the task also has a number of practical benefits. It is scalable in difficulty, suitable for repeated measures designs (meaning you can do it again and again – it isn’t something you learn once and then can’t be tested on any more) as well being adaptable for different species (meaning you can test humans and non-human animals on the task).\nThe paper is based on work done as part of the EU robotics project I’m on (’I’M-CLeVeR‘) and on Tom Walton’s PhD thesis, The Discovery of Novel Actions."

    "text": "Fundamentals of learning: the exploration-exploitation trade-off\nOriginally published 2012-06-06\nThe exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental dilemma whenever you learn about the world by trying things out. The dilemma is between choosing what you know and getting something close to what you expect (‘exploitation’) and choosing something you aren’t sure about and possibly learning more (‘exploration’). For example, suppose you are in a restaurant and you look at the menu:\n\nFish and chips\nChole poori\nPaneer uttappam\nKhara dosa\n\nAssuming for the sake of example that you’re not very good with Sri Lankan food, you’ve now got a choice. You can ‘exploit’ – go with the fish and chips, which will probably be alright – or you can ‘explore’ – try something you haven’t had before and see what you get. Obviously which you decide to do will depend on many things: how hungry you are, how good the restaurant reviews are, how adventurous you are, how often you reckon you’ll be coming back etc.\nWhat’s important is that the study of the best way to make these kinds of choices – called reinforcement learning – has shown that optimal learning requires that you to sometimes make some bad choices. This means that sometimes you have to choose to avoid the action you think will be most rewarding, and take an action which you think will be less rewarding.\nThe rationale is that these ‘sub-optimal’ actions are necessary for your long term benefit – you need to go off track sometimes to learn more about the environment. The exploration-exploitation dilemma is really a trade-off : enjoy more now vs learn more now and enjoy later. You can’t avoid it, all you can do is position yourself somewhere along the spectrum.\nBecause the trade-off is fundamental we would expect to be able to see it in all learning domains, not just restaurant food choices. In work just published, we’ve been using a new task to look at how actions are learnt.\nUsing a joystick we asked people to explore the space of all possible movements, giving them a signal when they made a particular target movement. This task – which we’re pretty keen on – gives us a lens to look at the relation between how people explore the possible movements they can make and which particular movements they learn to rely on to generate predictable outcomes (which we call ‘actions’).\nUsing data gathered from this task, it is possible to see the exploitation-exploration trade-off in action. With each target people get 10 attempts to try to identify the right movement to make. Obviously some successful movements will be more efficient than others, because it is possible to hit the target after going all “round the houses” first, adding lots of extraneous movements and taking longer than needed.\nIf you had a success like this you could repeat it exactly (‘exploit’), or try and cut out some of the extraneous movement and risk missing the target (‘explore’). Obviously this refinement of action through trial and error is of critical interest to anyone who cares about how we learn skilled movements.\nI calculated an average performance score for the first 50% and second 50% of attempts (basically a measure of distance travelled before hitting the target – so lower scores mean better performance). I also calculated how variable these performance scores were in the first 50% and second 50%.\nNormally we would expect people who perform best in the first half of a test to perform best in the second half (depressingly people who start out ahead usually stay there!). But this analysis showed up something interesting: a strong correlation between variability in the first half and performance in the second half. You can see this in the graph:\n\nThis shows that people who are most inconsistent when they start to learn perform best towards the end of learning. Usually inconsistency is a bad sign, so it is somewhat surprising that it predicts better performance later on. The obvious interpretation is in terms of the exploration-exploitation trade-off.\nThe inconsistent people are trying out more things at the beginning, learning more about what works and what doesn’t. This provides them with the foundation to perform well later on. This pattern holds when comparing across individuals, but it also holds for comparing across trials (so for the same individual, their later performance is better for targets on which they are most inconsistent on early in learning).\nYou can read about this, and more, in our new paper, which is open-access over at PLoS One A novel task for the investigation of action acquisition."

    "text": "From 2020-2025 I held the role of Research Practice Lead at the University of Sheffield. This was a University level, cross-faculty, leadership role. The mission was to raise the quality of our research, by supporing researcher engagement with those practices, processes and platforms which make research more reliable, more scalable and more transparent. A large part of this was understanding and advocating for open research practices, as they manifested across different disciplines - from medicine to history.\nIn this work I was the University representative on the UK Reproducibility Network./ As ‘Institutional Lead’ I worked on the UKRN’s Open Research Training Programme, which used a train-the-trainer model to reach thousands of researchers and train them in skills to use Open Research Practices. This was a huge multi-discipline, multi-institution, multi-year project and I learnt a lot being involved from application to the completion of the last trainings.\nAt the University I was supported by the the Open Research Working Group and the various committees I sat on which discussed University policy, such as the Vice President for Research’s Research Strategy Group, the Research Culture Steering Board, and the Open Research Advisory Group, which both included the Faculty Directors of Research and representatives for the Library and IT Services. All of which is to say that I spent a lot of time learning about University management and policy, and appreciating how much colleagues across the departments and services of the University contributed to it running as it did. I particularly recommend all academics to speak to their librarians more.\nActivities I initiated or led on during my time as Research Practice Lead - Led development and adoption of the University of Sheffield statement on Open Research - Initiated the Editors and Publishers Network - Submitted evidence to the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee report on Reproducibility and research integrity. Written evidence:Commercial involvement in academic publishing is key to research reliability and should face greater public scrutiny - Organised networking events, journal clubs, drop-in sessions and workshops on open research, reproducibility and metascience - Toured Departments from archaeology to civil engineering to speak on ‘research improvement’ and Open Research practices and policy - Helped develop and became co-chair of the new University Office for Open Research and Scholarship"
