    "text": "I teach and research in the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield as Professor of Cognitive Science. My research and teaching focuses on applying insights from neuroscience, experimental design and data science to the topics of learning, decision making, reasoning and bias.\nI direct the MSc programmes in Psychological Research Methods, and set up the MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. I teach a module on Data Management and Visualisation.\nAt the University I hold the position of Research Practice Lead, an institution-wide role with a remit to encourage practices which support robust and trusted research. As Research Practice Lead, I represent the University of Sheffield on the UK Reproducibility Network, for which I chair the national UKRN Institutional Leads group.\nAs Senior Fellow at the Research on Research Institute, I lead the programme AFIRE: Accelerator For Innovation & Research Funding Experimentation. We seek to catalyse the generation and use of high quality evidence on research processes (“Metaresearch”).\nI am on the PsyArXiv Scientific Advisory Board as chair of the Public Engagement Subcommittee.\nFor non-specialist audiences, I have written a best-selling book, an award winning blog and columns for venues including BBC, New Scientist, The Guardian and The Conversation. I have also written some mediocre selling books, some widely ignored blogs and tweeted jokes which I thought were hilarious at the time but which received precisely zero likes and zero retweets.\nThese pages are intended to replace tomstafford.sites.sheffield.ac.uk, and will reflect my professional activities.\nMy non-professional activities are recorded on my personal blog at https://idiolect.org.uk/notes/\nOr you can find traces on these other platforms:"

I am also interested in skill learning, using measures of behaviour informed by work done in computational theory and neuroscience. More recently a strand of my research looks at complex decisions, and the psychology of reason, argument and persuasion.\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nDecision Making, Bias\nReasoning\nMetaresearch\nData Science\nExperimental Design"
